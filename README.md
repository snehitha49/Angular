# Angular
In the given assignment we are asked to check the given condition and satisfy the condition that is about lunch check
we are first inserting a text box with comma seperated list of items in the text box and giving a condition that if the items entered in the textbox is 3 lets say item1, item2, item3 then we have to click on "check if too much" based on the condition is it is less than or equal to 3 then when we click it displays "enjoy"
if it is greater than 4 then it displays "too much". There is also another condition where we dont enter anything then we need to display alert message showing that "please enter the data first".
